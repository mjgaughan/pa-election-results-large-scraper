# pa-election-results-large-scraper

These files comprise a large multi-input pdf to csv data parser that I abandoned while working with primary 2020 data from Pennsylvania for [OpenElections](https://github.com/openelections).

I think this should work but also haven't really fully tested and tried it out. I just thought it would be a shame for the thing that I spent so much time on to just sit on my laptop.

processing_all_pa2020.py is the main file, with the other files holding smaller parsers that are called. 

I hope that someone can find some use for this.
